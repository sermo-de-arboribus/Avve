Avve is a parsing and text processing program that intends to supply text statistics that will facilitate training a data mining / machine learning algorithm for text classification later. 
To achieve its purpose, Avve produces output in XRFF format, which can be consumed by the Weka data mining applications, tools, and libraries, as well as being worked on with XML tools.
It is written in Java, handles dependencies via Maven, and is currently unfinished work-in-progress.
